            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, Iâ€™m </strong>Fritzgerald Wilson</strong> <strong>Twenty First Visuals</strong>. I was born and raised in <strong>Monrovia, Liberia</strong>. At the age of 14, I discovered my passion for visual arts. Bit by bit, I began to pursue it and four years later, by the overwhelming grace of the <strong>Almighty God</strong> I owned my first <strong>Nikon DSRL D5600</strong> camera. That was when my journey began.</p>

            <p>Photography has become more than just a craft for me. It's the way I see and feel the world around me and every photo I take is shaped by <strong>emotion</strong>, <strong>light</strong>, and <strong>perspective</strong>. Now, I am on mission to tell stories through my photography.</p>

            <p>Thank you for being a part of it.</p>
